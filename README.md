# hello-world
Repository that gets me started when learning Git and Github

Hi folks,

I'm kinda new one here. Years ago I used to code in Turbo Pascal and have had some other minor experience with coding. Now I want to learn Python and Django and kick-off my new career path as junior backend developer.
